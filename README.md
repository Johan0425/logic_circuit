# Logic Circuit Simulator

This project allows to simulate logic circuits with gates (AND, XOR, NAND, XNOR, OR, NOT, NOR). The user can define 2 to 4 inputs, manipulate the circuit, and view the results in an evaluation table.

## Instructions
1. Add gates or negate the output as needed.
2. View the results in the table and in the results section.
